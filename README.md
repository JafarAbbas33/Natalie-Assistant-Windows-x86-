# Natalie Assistant Windows x86

This project is intended on creating a personal assistant, using Python programming language. It uses Google Assistant SDK as a backened. This assistant is intended for Windows 32 bit. I have big hopes for this project and looking forward to your contributions on this project😁

[Trigger warning] I'm a beginner so my coding style is not good. I know that. Bear with me😅😂
